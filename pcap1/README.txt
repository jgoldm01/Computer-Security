1. there are 1503 packets in the set

2. FTP

3. FTP is an insecure protocol that sends your information to the computer or
server in plain text format, which means it can be picked up by anyone with
wireshark such as myself. 

4. SFTP is a secure alternative, as it does encrypt files. 

5. 67.23.79.113

6. username: ihackpineapples password: rockyou1

9. see files

set2.pcap
10. 77882 packetsa

11. 1 username password pair

12. I searched for the "user" "USER" "pass" "passwd" and "password" using
ettercap piped into grep, as well as using ngrep piped into grep. 

13. protocol: POP
server IP: 75.126.75.131
Domain name: stamps.com
port: 110

14. this user password pair was legitimate, because the tcp stream indicated
that the website accepted the pair, giving it the okay

15. I followed the tcp stream, and the server indicated that the pair was
legitimate by givin the okay message. 

16. I would advise that owners use only secure websites that use https rather
than http, because https encrypts packets whereas http allows them to be
delivered in plain text.
